### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**AshTraYro/AshTraYro** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting better on C++
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning --> C++ with Visual Studio || How to Use GitHub  || Linux (Ubuntu)
- I really hope i can make it.
- See you on the other side of the projects :).
